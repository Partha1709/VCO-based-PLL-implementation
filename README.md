# VCO-based-PLL-implementation
Design and Analysis of PLL based on Current Starved Ring VCO and Differential Pair VCO

Introduction: Phase Locked Loop is a control system that generates an output signal with a phase relationship to an input signal. It is a feedback circuit that generates an output that is in phase with the input signal. It controls or locks the phase and frequency errors of input signal. The PLL consists of several blocks. The Phase Frequency Detector(PFD), the Charge Pump, Low Pass Filter, Voltage-Controlled Oscillator(VCO).
